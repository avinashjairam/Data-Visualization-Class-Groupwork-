<h3>This graph shows that the first principal component contains approximately 40% of the variance of the entire distribution.</h3>

<h3>The second principal component has about 30% of the variance. These correspond to the eigenvectors which represent Average Temperature and Humidity hours above 90%. </h3>

<h3>This makes sense because less walking is done when both the temperature and humidity is high.</h3>
